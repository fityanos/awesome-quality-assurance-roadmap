:closed_book: Below you can find and introduce yourself to the main aspects and technologies that you need to understand and cover if you are planning to start a career in QA Engineering.

:closed_book: This road map is not the optimal as you can add some more types and methodologies, but focusing on the main point behind it... I would say that you can find your path out of it :octocat:

 :bug: One of the most important and essential parts to understand and start with is understanding Testing Fundamentals, as this understanding phase can be the positive difference between good and excellent QA Engineer by achieve higher test scenarios coverage and how the system work
 
 :bug: How to start testing and when to use this testing type or that one as examples, can improve the software life cycle and development

> “It’s automation, not automagic.” — Jim Hazen

:crystal_ball: I encourage any QA Engineer to ensure that above is wrapped up before starting with automation, as i would say that the main key feature for automation is to `Document Manually Written Test Cases`  and `Engineering` it in a way the code will be `readable` `understandable` and `reusable`.
